        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>Hi there! This is <strong className="blue">Jose Daniel Villa</strong>, I am 22-year-old from <strong>Colombia
            💛💙❤️</strong>, with over 3 years of experience in customer service. I love creating dynamic web
            applications, always prioritizing SEO and user accessibility. My favorite framework is <span className="green">React.js</span>;
            I find the concepts of components and context particularly fascinating. While <span className="yellow">JavaScript</span> is my top choice,
            I’m also exploring Python to unlock its incredible potential in AI.✨
        </p>

        <p>Outside of programming and customer service, I enjoy playing music, creating animations, and organizing my
            life with <strong>Notion</strong> to plan my gym training 💪🏻. I love meeting new people and welcome
            insights and advice from others. I'm passionate about learning and understanding the foundations of
            concepts. Nice to meet you—let’s connect and collaborate!
        </p>
